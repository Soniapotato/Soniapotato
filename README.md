### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Becoming a software engineer did not happen over night. 

Jumping from finance to computer science has been a big change and risk, but a comfortable one. Finding a place where my problem solving skills can shine and always be utilize has been satisfying. After working in construction and finance, one thing held persistent; I like using technology to make things easier for myself and coworkers. 

Working smarter not harder was always my motto and I found that software engineering met me in the middle. In this transition, I started off with formal education where I dove into C++, Java and Python. After learning a good foundation, it was time to enter in a more intense program to sharpen and test that foundation. 

After entering Hack Reactor, I now have actual experience with being a full stack engineer. Although back-end development is where I shine, I am always up for a challenge. As I continue through this advance program, I was able to learn many technologies and invest over 1,000 hours into become a top software engineer.
